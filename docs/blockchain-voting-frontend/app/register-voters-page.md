#### **Overview**
The `RegisterMultipleVotersPage` component allows administrators to register multiple voters simultaneously for an active election. It provides functionality to add voter addresses, manage the list dynamically, and submit them to the blockchain.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Admin Authentication**:
   - Secures the page with `withAdminAuth`, ensuring only authorized administrators can access it.

2. **Election Management**:
   - Lists active elections and supports pagination for managing large election lists.

3. **Batch Voter Registration**:
   - Allows administrators to input multiple voter addresses using comma-separated values or by pressing Enter after each address.

4. **Feedback and Validation**:
   - Displays alerts for success, errors, and progress.
   - Ensures an election is selected and at least one voter address is added before submission.

5. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Fetches and displays active elections dynamically.
   - Updates voter lists in real-time.
