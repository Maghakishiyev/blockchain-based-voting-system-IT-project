## Factory: `BlockchainVoting__factory`

### Description
The `BlockchainVoting__factory` class is an extension of the `ContractFactory` from the `ethers` library. It simplifies the creation and connection to the `BlockchainVoting` contract by providing pre-configured methods and the ABI/bytecode required for deployment.

---

### Properties

#### `static readonly abi`
- **Type**: `Array<Object>`
- **Description**: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the `BlockchainVoting` contract. It defines all events, functions, and their input/output parameters.

#### `static readonly bytecode`
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The bytecode of the `BlockchainVoting` smart contract, required for deployment.

---

### Methods

#### `createInterface()`
- **Returns**: `BlockchainVotingInterface`
- **Description**: Creates and returns an interface instance for interacting with the `BlockchainVoting` contract.

#### `connect(address: string, runner?: ContractRunner | null)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `address`: The deployed contract's address.
  - `runner`: Optional. An instance of `ContractRunner` (e.g., `Signer` or `Provider`) for interacting with the contract.
- **Returns**: `BlockchainVoting`
- **Description**: Connects to an already deployed `BlockchainVoting` contract.

#### `deploy(overrides?: NonPayableOverrides & { from?: string })`
- **Parameters**:
  - `overrides`: Optional. Deployment options such as `from` (address initiating the deployment).
- **Returns**: `Promise<BlockchainVoting & { deploymentTransaction(): ContractTransactionResponse }>`
- **Description**: Deploys a new instance of the `BlockchainVoting` contract.

#### `getDeployTransaction(overrides?: NonPayableOverrides & { from?: string })`
- **Parameters**:
  - `overrides`: Optional. Deployment options such as `from` (address initiating the deployment).
- **Returns**: `Promise<ContractDeployTransaction>`
- **Description**: Prepares the transaction for deploying the `BlockchainVoting` contract.

#### `connect(runner: ContractRunner | null)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `runner`: An instance of `ContractRunner` (e.g., `Signer` or `Provider`) for interacting with the factory.
- **Returns**: `BlockchainVoting__factory`
- **Description**: Connects the factory to a `ContractRunner`.

### Usage Example

#### Deploying a Contract
```typescript
import { BlockchainVoting__factory } from "./BlockchainVoting__factory";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const signer = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().connect(provider);
const factory = new BlockchainVoting__factory(signer);

const contract = await factory.deploy({ from: signer.address });
console.log("Contract deployed at:", contract.address);
```

#### Connecting to an Existing Contract
```typescript
import { BlockchainVoting__factory } from "./BlockchainVoting__factory";

const address = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"; // Deployed contract address
const contract = BlockchainVoting__factory.connect(address, signer);

console.log("Connected to contract at:", contract.address);
```
