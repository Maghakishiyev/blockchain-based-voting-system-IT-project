# `index.ts` Documentation

## Overview

The `index.ts` file serves as an autogenerated entry point for exporting factory classes from the `blockchain-voting-frontend/contracts/server/factories/` directory. This file simplifies imports by aggregating and re-exporting factory modules. 

**Note:** This file is autogenerated and should not be edited manually.

## Purpose

- Provides a centralized export for the factory classes.
- Simplifies module imports in other parts of the application.
- Ensures maintainability and consistency when the factories are regenerated.

## Key Exports

### `BlockchainVoting__factory`
This is the factory class for the `BlockchainVoting` smart contract. It allows for:
- Deploying the `BlockchainVoting` contract.
- Connecting to an existing instance of the `BlockchainVoting` contract.
- Accessing the `ABI` and `bytecode` of the contract.

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
import { BlockchainVoting__factory } from './factories';

// Connecting to an existing contract
const contractAddress = '0xYourContractAddress';
const contract = BlockchainVoting__factory.connect(contractAddress, signer);

// Deploying a new contract
const factory = new BlockchainVoting__factory(signer);
const deployedContract = await factory.deploy();
```

## File Metadata

- **Autogenerated**: This file is autogenerated by tools like TypeChain and should not be edited manually.
- **Generated by**: TypeChain.
- **Location**: `blockchain-voting-frontend/contracts/server/factories/`

## Development Notes

1. **Regeneration**: If the contract factories are updated, this file will be automatically updated as well.
2. **Avoid Manual Edits**: Any changes made directly to this file will be lost during regeneration.
